Group Announcement: Reminder about the use of administrator privileges

Hello everyone.
I would like to remind you a little bit about the administrator's privilege, I hope you can help to maintain the operation of the group based on the principle of fairness and mutual respect.

Our administrators have been doing a great job so far, and we thank you all for your help. However, in order to avoid possible disputes in the future, we would like to make it clear that if any administrator abuses his/her authority, kicks people out, messes with the group settings, or even damages the trust of the group or betrays the group, we will deal with it in a serious manner, including revoking the administrator's privileges, and we will make a public announcement to explain this if necessary.

We are not targeting anyone, this is purely a precautionary measure to make the whole group more transparent and secure, and to protect the rights of every member.

Thank you for your cooperation and support, and we will continue to maintain this warm and fun space together!
